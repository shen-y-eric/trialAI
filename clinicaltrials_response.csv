NCT06375135,mHealth + e-Navigator Stepped Care on ART Adherence in Latino MSM,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06375135,Project STEP,RECRUITING,"The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of stepped care strategies to improve ART adherence among adult Latino MSM with HIV using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART). The trial will compare a stepped care strategy of delivering TXTXT (""Treatment Text"") first and stepping up to remote patient navigation for non-responders vs. a stepped care strategy of delivering TXTXT + e-Navigation first and stepping up to EMA-supported e-Navigation for non-responders. Both TXTXT and the foundations of the e-Navigation interventions are CDC evidence-based interventions (EBI). We propose to use a SMART design which explicitly allows building, testing, and optimizing stepped care strategies without compromising rigor or randomization. We propose three specific aims:

Aim 1. Compare the immediate (6-month) and sustained (9- and 12-month) efficacy of two static (non-stepped) treatment regimens (TXTXT alone vs. TXTXT + e-Navigation) on ART adherence and viral suppression among Latino MSM with HIV.

Compare the immediate (6-month) and sustained (9- and 12-month) efficacy of two stepped care strategies (TXTXT with added e-Navigation for non-responders vs. TXTXT + e-Navigation with added EMA support for non-responders) on ART adherence and viral suppression among Latino MSM with HIV. Hypothesis 2a: TXTXT + e-Navigation with added EMA support for non-responders at the 3-month follow-up will be more efficacious than TXTXT with added e-Navigation for non-responders at the 3-month follow-up. Aim 3. Identify baseline and time-varying moderators on the association between stepped care strategy and ART adherence and viral suppression among Latino MSM with HIV.

NCT05584397,Comparing Immune Activation and Latent HIV Reservoir Size Between People Living With HIV on Tenofovir-containing Versus NRTI-free ART,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05584397,,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"The goal of the project is to determine the difference in immune activation and HIV reservoir size between People living with HIV (PWH) on tenofovir-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) versus PWH on nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-sparing ART. Tenofovir (TFV), a phosphonated nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), is being used for oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).

The investigators will test this hypothesis: tenofovir, and perhaps NRTIs in general, stimulate a type I/III interferon also in PWH who take these drugs. Because chronic interferon stimulation may promote the survival and proliferation of cells with integrated provirus, the investigators also hypothesize that these drugs antagonize decay of the HIV latent reservoir in PWH on ART. Consequently, the researchers hypothesize that PWH who have switched from NRTI-containing ART to NRTI-sparing ART exhibit lower type I/III interferon pathway activation and lower latent HIV reservoir size.

The investigators also hypothesize that independently of treatment, the extent of type I/III interferon activation correlates with latent HIV reservoir size.

Thus, the proposed study seeks to answer these two questions. Can the gastrointestinal epithelium be impacted by ART, and contribute to chronic immune activation and expansion of the HIV-1 reservoir? If so, what therapeutic approaches can the investigators implement to reduce the HIV-1 proviral load? The data will reveal pathways that can be targeted therapeutically to treat chronic immune activation in PWH.

NCT04709302,Effects of COVID-19 on Endothelium in HIV-Positive Patients in Sub-Saharan Africa,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04709302,ENDOCOVID,ENROLLING_BY_INVITATION,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected almost every country in the world, especially in terms of health system capacity and economic burden. People from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) often face interaction between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease. Role of HIV infection and anti-retroviral treatment (ART) in altered cardiovascular risk is questionable and there is still need to further carry out research in this field. However, thus far it is unclear, what impact the COVID-19 co-infection in people living with HIV (PLHIV), with or without therapy will have. The ENDOCOVID project aims to investigate whether and how HIV-infection in COVID-19 patients modulates the time course of the disease, alters cardiovascular risk, and changes vascular endothelial function and coagulation parameters/ thrombosis risk.

Methods: In this long-term study, cardiovascular research on PLHIV with or without ART with COVID-19 and HIV-negative with COVID-19 will be carried out via clinical and biochemical measurements for cardiovascular risk factors and biomarkers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vascular and endothelial function will be measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) assessments, and retinal blood vessel analyses, along with vascular endothelial biomarkers and coagualation markers. The correlation between HIV-infection in COVID-19 PLHIV with or without ART and its role in enhancement of cardiovascular risk and endothelial dysfunction will be assessed. Potential changes in these endpoints by COVID-19 will be followed for 4 weeks across the three groups (PLHIVwith or without ART and HIV negatives).

Impact of project: The ENDOCOVID project aims to evaluate in the long-term the cardiovascular risk and vascular endothelial function in PLHIV thus revealing an important transitional cardiovascular phenotype in COVID-19.",NO,Covid19|Hiv|ART,BIOLOGICAL: COVID-19|BIOLOGICAL: HIV|DRUG: ART,"Number of patients developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Comparison of all three groups, recorded for each patient, through study completion, up to 3 months|Number of ICU admissions, Comparison of all three groups, recorded for each patient, through study completion, up to 3 months|Number of Deaths, Comparison of all three groups, through study completion, up to 3 months","Cardiometabolic Status: ADMA, Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) as marker for endothelial function (from blood sample) measured via commercially available ELISA kits, through study completion, an average of 3 months|Cardiometabolic Status: Cholesterol, To assess the lipid profile, cholesterol levels will be assessed via blood samples in a routine laboratory, through study completion, an average of 3 months|Cardiometabolic Status: Triglycerides, To assess the lipid profile, triglyceride concentrations will be assessed via blood samples in a routine laboratory, through study completion, an average of 3 months|Cardiometabolic Status: HDL cholesterol, To assess the lipid profile, HDL cholesterol concentrations will be assessed via blood samples in a routine laboratory, through study completion, an average of 3 months|Cardiometabolic Status: LDL cholesterol, To assess the lipid profile, LDL cholesterol concentrations will be assessed via blood samples in a routine laboratory, through study completion, an average of 3 months|Cardiometabolic Status: Glucose, Assessed via blood samples in a routine laboratory, through study completion, an average of 3 months|Cardiometabolic Status: Glycated Hemoglobin, HbA1c as marker for diabetes, assessed via blood samples in a routine laboratory, through study completion, an average of 3 months|Cardiometabolic Status: hs-CRP, high sensitivity CRP as inflammatory marker, assessed via blood samples in a routine laboratory, through study completion, an average of 3 months|Endothelial function and vascular changes: FMD, Assessed non-invasively using ultrasound in the brachial artery (flow mediated dilatation), through study completion, an average of 3 months|Endothelial function and vascular changes: PWV, PWV, a marker of aortic stiffness, is most commonly measured as the time it takes a pulse wave to travel from the carotid to the femoral arteries divided by the distance multiplied by 0.8.
